      <h1>Tony Blair: Afghanistan withdrawal is 'tragic, dangerous, and unnecessary'</h1>
      <p>Tony Blair lambasted the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in an article on his institute's website, stating that
        the decision to leave is "political" rather than "strategic".

        "The abandonment of Afghanistan and its people is tragic, dangerous, unnecessary, not in their interests and not
        in ours," the former British prime minister wrote.
