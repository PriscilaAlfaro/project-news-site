# Week 2-Technigo bootcamp

# News Site
This weekâ€™s project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop.

This project is about tech news, including different sections according to the instructions. The repo was fork from https://github.com/Technigo/project-news-site 

## The problem
The project sticks to the design provided by teachers. It has 4 main sections: navbar, big news, small news, and a section with videos. It also contains three different animations and a footer. 

Everything was designed in plain Html and CSS without any library. The first step was to build the Html main structure and then populate it with information and images. The next step was to continue with the CSS  and responsive design with breakpoints for tablets and desktops. I started with desktop-first design but according to best practices we saw in classes, I changed the design to mobile-first. Once I had the main requirements I complimented the project with details in CSS like hover, colors and added the animations and videos. 

Most of the project was built with flexbox, but the video and footer section with grid in order to have some practice about this topics. 

The project represents a nice practice about flexbox, grid, responsive design, and a motivation to search more about new subjects like animations and continuous deployment.
